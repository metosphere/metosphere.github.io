          <h3>
            Astros Sponsor Boycott
          </h3>
          <p>Remember that we have power as fans.  Our best move is to go after the sponsors and make the Astros name toxic to be associated with.
          <br/><br/>
          Continue to tweet at the Astros' sponsors and ask if they support cheating.
          <br/><br/>
          Look at where the Astros play...where all of this happened...Enron Field, now Minute Maid Park! They're Cheaters AND Juicers!
           We bet that's even LOW fructose corn syrup in their orange juice. #BoycottMinuteMaid
          <br/><br/>
          The #NikeCheaters meme is amazing!  Keep spreading memes and boycotting the equipment sponsors until they drop the cheaters.

          <h3>
            Green Lasers vs. Red Lasers
          </h3>
          <p>Our eyesâ€™ sensitivity peaks at around the wavelength of green light. Green light also scatters more in the atmosphere than red light does,
           so green lasers appear more powerful than red ones.
           <br/><br/>
           <p>Raiders fans, we realize that red lasers are canon for the Dark Side, and that you still have laser pointers from the final 
           Coliseum game. But just this once, think Yoda over Vader here. Remember, A's=green.  You'll be seeing red anyway over all the injustice!

          <li>Take the 7th inning stretch to get loose and warm up.</li>
          <li>Don't forget everything happens after 1 out in the bottom of the 7th, so stay hydrated throughout the game and be ready.</li>
          <li>Keep extra water bottles on hand to avoid lines (and for your friends).</li>

              </h3>
              <p>
              Before the 7th inning take note of your entry/egress points.  Remember the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake at the Coliseum.
               Think about where you'd go in the event of an "earthquake drill".
